## Overview
For this project I worked on a dataset for a fictitious alternative meat company named Improbable Beef. The company was analyzing samples of bacteria found in the navel of participants for potential use in a future product. Samples were collected and catalogued in the belly button biodiversity dataset. Our task was to create an interactive dashboard that would allow participants to view the bacteria samples  (operational taxonomic units or OTUs) that were most present in their navels to see if they were a good candidate for Improbable Beef. The dashboard includes a bar graph of the top 10 bacteria present for each participant, a bubble chart displaying the quantity of each bacteria present, and a gauge chart showing the wash frequency of the partcipant.
